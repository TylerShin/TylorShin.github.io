## Background

I've been working with React for 3 years, and agonize over using React or Redux more. it's kind of retrospective for my past results.

I always welcome feedback.

## DISCLAIMER

This is not an official architecture and not the best practice for everyone.
Please read this article for one of the references.

Also, it has strong coupling with Redux and Typescript. So, if you're using Apollo client or MobX for state manager, the content might not meet with your taste.

## Purpose

- High component reusability (â‰ˆ less coupling)
- Productivity
- Secure system
