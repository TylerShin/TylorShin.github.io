# Things IDK as of 2018

I was impressed by the [blog post](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/) written by Dan Abramov and decide to write a similar post too.

My intent is NOT to reduce the gap between experienced developers and newbies. I think of that if you want to **fix or enhance** something, you should know what is the missing part.

Recently, I've strongly felt about the lack of CS materials like Algorithm, Design Pattern, and also. I want to learn about them and apply that knowledge to our projects. I believe that it's the fastest way to enhance development skill for now.

So, below's are the list of things I don't know much yet.

---

- **SQL.** I know `SELECT * FROM *` freaks people out. I always prefer to use ORM like Active Record. When I need a complex query or optimizing query for performance, I've asked a Backend developer for help. I know SQL's basic syntax and the concept is simple. However, I've got no chance to learn about it.
- **Unix commands and Bash.** I can use a basic pipe syntax to find and kill Node process. Also, I can use VI to change the file in Terminal when I have to use SSH. I've always been troubled with Bash Script that related with the deploy logic. I prefer to use Node or Go Lang for checking the file size.
- **Low level typed language.** I tried to use Go Lang for my first low-level language. However, Go Lang has no reason to use `malloc` or control threads by myself. I know what malloc, pointer, Dynamic Memory Allocation but never use it in my main language.
- **Design Pattern.** Recently I feel a strong demand for this. Because our project becomes huge, and I always think of refactoring for effective code structure. It will make us faster and increase our productivity. After I read `Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code` , I much more feel that it's important and essential for every programmer.
- **Operating System.** I always have curious about how the operating system works. Also when I try to learn about the core of language, (example: Node's thread pool) I've been blocked by OS related things.(syscall, stdin, stdout, ...). I read some chapters of `Operating System Concepts` but there was no time to read all of them yet.
- **Algorithm.** I know what is the heap sort is. Also I know what O(N) means too. But I don't know what knapsack is, DFS, Graph theories. What I know is more than O(N^2) is EVIL.
- **Data Structure.** I know Queue, Stack, and other basic data structures. However, I don't know how to properly do Tree Rotation, Graph methods.
- **Virtual-DOM, Shadow-DOM.** What I know is they are different at all. Virtual-DOM is living in memory and generally be used by modern frontend libraries(ex: React). Shadow-DOM is a part of the Web Component.
- **Functional Language.** I watched a few video clips why Functional Language is great. I've learned about the reason why side effect sucks, Pure Function and Memoization. But I never tried ClosureScript or Haskell yet.
- **Layout Engine.** I know Chrome and Safari uses Webkit, Firefox uses Gecko. Edge will use Webkit...(as a big fan of Mozilla, I agree it's super bad choice.) I read [how QuantumCSS works in Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/). But I never read source code or know the main design pattern.
- **ML.** I heard about Deep Learning, AlphaGO. lol. What I know is the model is a result of training. And the model already made is not a big burden to implementation. Some of my colleague always say 'Study and Do real statistics much more right than ML'. However I've never sincerely try them.

These are all I can come up with now. I don't think I have to learn them all this year.

I just wish that I can learn and apply more fundamental CS concepts to our projects.

Just bought some books (GoF Design pattern, Algorithm, ... ) and trying to allocate my time to study.

Thanks for reading, and Happy new year!
