From today, AWS Lambda supports NodeJS 8.10.  

You can migrate to the NodeJS 8.10 with this [migration guide](https://forum.serverless.com/t/aws-node-8-10-runtime-for-lambdas-migration-guide/4141/3).  

tl;dr: just change `runtime: nodejs6.10` to `runtime: nodejs8.10` at the `serverless.yml` file.  

**caution**
IDK why but for some reason, AWS Lambda@Edge doesn't support NodeJS 8.10.  
So, If you set Lambda@Edge function in the same `serverless.yml` file, that will make an error like below.  

```
An error occurred: CloudFrontDistribution - The function has an invalid runtime for functions that are triggered by a CloudFront event: nodejs8.10 Expecting: nodejs6.10 Function:   arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:966390130392:function:~~~~:13 (Service: AmazonCloudFront; Status Code: 400; Error Code: InvalidLambdaFunctionAssociation; Request ID: 0d529603-37e3-11e8-bcb4-3d379f0b0c9a).
```

You can avoid that error by overriding the runtime property like above image.  
If you write `runtime: nodejs6.10` inside of the each function, it overrides the global setting.  
So, just override it inside of the Lambda@Edge function setting.
